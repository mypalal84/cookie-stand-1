      <p>Welcome to Pat's Salmon Cookies! When enjoying your cup of coffee in the morning, is there anything better than pairing your coffee with a delicious treat? Here at Pat's Salmon Cookies, we make gormet cookies from ground salmon. First, we grind the salmon very fine and then we bake it into a cookie that will remind you of the great northwest. Not only are our cookies a healthy option for your morning, they are also delicious!
